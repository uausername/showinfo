# showinfo

showinfo is an interactive infographic builder that fetches TV-show data through public APIs and presents them with dynamic charts.

## Features
- South Park and Bob's Burgers API clients with data normalization and caching.
- Unified TypeScript models for shows, episodes, characters, and quotes.
- React-based interface for browsing shows, episodes, and characters.
- Interactive Chart.js component with selectable datasets (counts or episodes per season) and chart types (bar or pie).
- Graceful handling when no API is available (e.g., Family Guy).

## APIs
- [South Park API](https://publicapi.dev/south-park-quotes-api/) for characters, episodes, locations, and quotes.
- [Bob's Burgers API](https://publicapi.dev/bob-s-burgers-api/) for episodes, characters, and quotes.
- Family Guy currently lacks a public API; future updates may link to alternative sources like IMDb or TMDb.

## Visualization Libraries
- **Chart.js** is currently integrated for quick bar and pie charts.
- Future plans include exploring **D3.js** and **Plotly.js** for richer, interactive infographics.
